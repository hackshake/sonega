Social Network for Gamers

The present problem faced by the gamers is that there is no specific site for gamers to interact .Facebook and other online steams are there but they are not so efficient for finding unknown people and also there are lot of people online other than gamers who make the searching process difficult. But this can be made easier by making a software which will give suggestions, locations and other details of the players , requested by the user. The software will also suggest some players to the user on the basis of his gaming interests which he gave to the software while registering into it.
SCOPE:-
1. Gamer registration
2. Status tracking of other gamers
3. Gamer location
4. Games preferred by the user
